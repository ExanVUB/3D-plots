# 3D-plots

This repository contains a Python script for creating a 3D plot using matplotlib. The plot visualizes data from an Excel file.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`
- `matplotlib` (version 3.4.0 or higher)
- `pandas` (version 1.3.0 or higher)

2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (see Installation section).
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```
   python script.py
   ```

   Note: You may need to modify the file paths in the script if your data file is located in a different directory.

5. The script will generate a 3D plot based on the data in the Excel file and display it.

## Data

The script reads data from an Excel file called `197 supraorb python.xlsx`. Make sure you have this file in the same directory as the `script.py` file. You can modify the data or use a different data source by updating the file path in the script.
